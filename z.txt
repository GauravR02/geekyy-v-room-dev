setting up the meeting calls, not the actual meeting room but a waiting list setup, where we can setup the mic camera of choice and more and then we can join the actual meeting room.. lets proceed with the creating with setup page..for that have to create streamCall and streamTheme and import components such like MeetingSetup and MeetingRoom..and using hooks for user and isLoaded adding to that the other one will be is SetupComplete and SetIsSetupComplete..we are using a special variable call but to get access ti that special variable had to create a custom hook..created the hooks folder and file named as useGetCallById.ts. A hook is just a Function starting with word use..into that we are creating a useEffect with a condition of !client return ; and a async function and call it immediately, now we have query call of the calls and query it with the filer which is id .. finally we are returning call and isCallLoading.. that's what hooks are for you call a couple of hooks you do some logic and then simply return the output..Now in the hooks section we are returning the Loader component with the condition of isLoaded or isCallLoading due to which we have teh access call.. we will know exactly which call we are in.
