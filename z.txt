Done with the meeting calls setup and now heading towards setting up the meeting..and within MeetingSetup component will render our first ever streamVideo component called VideoPreview ..now we have to allow localhost to access the camera and microphone.. lets create useState and useEffect to ensuring the access for cam and microphone.. just because the camera was "not" accessible, had to use the phone as a webcam, everything was working totally fine. now just added the checkbox for to join with cam or not..adding the DeviceSettings component from video react sdk. including the Shadcn button component for joining the meeting..to use it with the app modified the hook and set the value to boolean and return a void.
